# Hardware Requirements and Optimization Guide

This guide helps you understand what hardware you need and how to optimize the neural LLM training project for your specific setup.

## Hardware Categories

### 1. Consumer Laptop (Your Setup: 32GB RAM, integrated/basic GPU)
**What you can do:**
- ✅ Train small language models (10-50M parameters)
- ✅ Experiment with model architectures
- ✅ Test data pipelines and preprocessing
- ✅ Run inference and text generation
- ✅ Fine-tune small models on custom data

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Training large models (500M+ parameters) will be very slow
- ❌ Limited to smaller context lengths (256-512 tokens)
- ❌ Batch sizes must be very small (1-2)

**Recommended Model Size:** 10-50M parameters

### 2. Mid-Range GPU Setup (RTX 3060/4060, 16-24GB system RAM)
**What you can do:**
- ✅ Train medium language models (100-300M parameters)
- ✅ Use longer context lengths (512-1024 tokens)
- ✅ Faster training with reasonable batch sizes

**Recommended Model Size:** 100-300M parameters

### 3. High-End Setup (RTX 4090, 32GB+ system RAM)
**What you can do:**
- ✅ Train large language models (500M-1B+ parameters)
- ✅ Full context lengths (1024+ tokens)
- ✅ Large batch sizes and efficient training

**Recommended Model Size:** 500M-1B+ parameters

## Your Surface Pro Setup - Optimized Configuration

### Recommended Settings for 32GB Surface Pro:

```yaml
# Small but capable model
model:
  n_layers: 6           # 6 transformer layers
  n_heads: 8            # 8 attention heads
  n_embd: 512           # 512 hidden dimensions
  vocab_size: 32000     # Smaller vocabulary
  block_size: 256       # 256 token context length
  
training:
  batch_size: 1         # Small batches
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 32  # Simulate larger batches
  use_amp: true         # Mixed precision to save memory
  gradient_checkpointing: true     # Trade compute for memory
```

**This will create a ~20M parameter model that:**
- Uses ~2-4GB of RAM during training
- Trains in reasonable time on CPU
- Can generate coherent text
- Is perfect for learning and experimentation

## Quick Hardware Check

Run this command to automatically detect your hardware and create optimized configs:

```bash
python scripts/hardware_setup.py
```

This will:
1. Analyze your system (RAM, GPU, CPU)
2. Recommend the best configuration
3. Create optimized config files
4. Estimate memory usage

## Training Time Expectations

### On Your Surface Pro (CPU training):
- **Tiny Model (5M params):** ~1 hour for basic training
- **Small Model (20M params):** ~4-8 hours for basic training  
- **Medium Model (50M params):** ~12-24 hours for basic training

### With GPU acceleration:
- **Basic GPU:** 5-10x faster than CPU
- **High-end GPU:** 20-50x faster than CPU

## Memory Management Tips for Your Hardware

### 1. Enable Memory-Saving Features:
```python
# In your training config
use_amp: true                    # Mixed precision (FP16)
gradient_checkpointing: true     # Trade compute for memory
compile_model: false            # Avoid PyTorch compilation overhead
```

### 2. Use Gradient Accumulation:
```python
batch_size: 1                   # Physical batch size
gradient_accumulation_steps: 32 # Effective batch size = 32
```

### 3. Optimize Data Loading:
```python
num_workers: 2          # Fewer data loading processes
pin_memory: false       # Don't pin memory on CPU systems
```

## Cloud Training Options

If you want to train larger models, consider these cloud options:

### Free Options:
1. **Google Colab (Free):** 
   - 12-16GB RAM, basic GPU
   - Good for models up to 100M parameters
   - Free tier has time limits

2. **Kaggle Notebooks:**
   - 16GB RAM, GPU available
   - Similar to Colab

### Paid Options:
1. **Google Colab Pro ($10/month):**
   - Better GPUs, longer sessions
   - Can train 300M+ parameter models

2. **AWS/Azure/GCP:**
   - Full control, pay per hour
   - Can scale to any model size

## Development Workflow for Your Hardware

### Phase 1: Development (Your Surface Pro)
- Use tiny/small configurations
- Develop and test all code components
- Verify data pipeline works
- Test inference and generation

### Phase 2: Training (Cloud or better hardware)
- Scale up to larger configurations
- Run full training sessions
- Fine-tune on your specific data

### Phase 3: Deployment (Your Surface Pro)
- Download trained models
- Run inference locally
- Generate text and experiment

## Sample Commands for Your Hardware

```bash
# 1. Check your hardware
python scripts/hardware_setup.py

# 2. Download and prepare a small dataset
python data/download_datasets.py --dataset wikipedia --limit 10000

# 3. Train tokenizer
python data/tokenizer.py

# 4. Preprocess data
python data/preprocess.py

# 5. Train small model (will run overnight)
python scripts/train.py --config config/hardware_configs.yaml --hardware consumer_laptop

# 6. Generate text
python scripts/generate.py --prompt "The future of AI is" --model checkpoints/best_model.pt
```

## Expected Results

With your Surface Pro setup, you can expect to:

✅ **Successfully train a working language model** (20M parameters)
✅ **Generate coherent text** on topics in your training data
✅ **Understand the full ML pipeline** from data to inference
✅ **Experiment with different architectures** and hyperparameters
✅ **Fine-tune on your own datasets**

The model won't be as capable as ChatGPT, but it will:
- Complete sentences and paragraphs
- Show understanding of basic grammar and facts
- Work as a foundation for experimentation
- Teach you everything about LLM training

## Next Steps

1. **Run hardware analysis:** `python scripts/hardware_setup.py`
2. **Start with tiny model:** Get familiar with the pipeline
3. **Scale up gradually:** Try small, then medium configurations
4. **Consider cloud training:** For larger experiments

Your Surface Pro is perfectly capable of running this project - you'll learn everything about LLM training while working within practical hardware constraints!
